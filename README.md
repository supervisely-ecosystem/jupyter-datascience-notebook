## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents.
It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

You can run JupyterLab server (app) from Supervisely on your computer with preinstalled Supervisely Agent. It comes with default `demo.ipynb` notebook for quick tests.

**ðŸŒŽ Note For Comunity Edition Users ðŸŒŽ**

Community users can run this application only on their own agents. Just go to Cluster page and connect your computer to your Supervisely account ([how to video](https://youtu.be/aDqQiYycqyk)).

## Basic usage

### How to run

Run app from the `.ipynb` **file in Team Files** or from the **folder in Team files**. For quick start to try demo notebook you can run the app **from Ecosystem**. Wait for jupyter server to start, demo notebook will show up.

### Shutdown application

Once your work with Jupyter is finished, you need to do the following steps:

1. âœ…âœ…âœ… Important âœ…âœ…âœ…: Download files from Jupyter to you local computer before shutdown. By default all app files are stored on the computer where your Supervisely Agent is running. All details about how to store your notebooks in Supervisely, how to access them at any time in Team Files and how to find them on the your computer with Agent will be covered soon in [Advanced usage chapter](#Advanced-usage).

2. Shutdown app

## Advanced usage

This section will explain, how to store your notebooks in Supervisely, how to find them on your computer, how to preview them in `Team Files`.

Every notebook in team files can be quickly previewed before run:

You also can run Jupyter notebook from Team File (use existing notebook or upload from your computer using drag-and-drop):

By default all your notebooks are stored on the computer where agent is running. Also Supervisely allows to preview agent's files right in Team Files in web interface. You can open session info in get the paths where files are actually stored on your computer or get the link to Team Files to preview them in Supervisely:

## Demo

Supervisely jupyter datascience notebook app comes with an example notebook explaining how to:

1. Create supervisely API object
2. Get user info
3. List all the user teams
